    <p>SASP is a student-led organization at the University of California, Berkeley dedicated to advancing the field of academic social justice.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to create a space where students can explore and develop their academic and professional skills, as well as learn about and practice social justice principles and values.</p>
    <p>We host events, workshops, and social activities to foster academic and professional development, as well as to connect students with resources and support.</p>
    <p>We are currently working on developing a website to serve as a central hub for our activities and resources.</p>
